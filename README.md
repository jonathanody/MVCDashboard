# MVCDashboard
A demonstration app that showcases a Metro style dashboard built using ASP.NET MVC - http://mvcdash.azurewebsites.net/

I built this in May 2013 as a pet project following a conversation with a senior manager as an implementation of an idea that they had to better visualize project / release progress.

## Built with:
* ASP.NET MVC (Originally version 3 but upgraded to version 4)
* Metro UI CSS library
* High Charts Javascript library
* Javascript
